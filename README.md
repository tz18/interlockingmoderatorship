# interlockingmoderatorship
I graphed reddit based on moderator overlap.

Reddit is one of the biggest single organs of discussion and deliberation on the web. It is also completely moderated by volunteers. Are some skilled ones doing all the work? Do moderators looking to recruit new moderators draw from people they've already worked with, or from their subscribers? What large networks of subreddits with the same moderators are there? I looked at a network of reddit moderators and the subreddits they moderate to get closer to answering some of these questions.

Here's a google doc with the results: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZDNr-SeqNNdwN6yv1YauA_yXeshmYU1HWdcP_cm91wg/edit
